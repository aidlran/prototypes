This was me prototyping a project management style application back when when I was first finding my feet with web development in uni. It is a frameworkless PHP application using a LAMP/WAMP stack.

I've left almost everything as it was back then so that I can look back and have a good chuckle in several year's time, however I dockerized so I've had to change some database config values and paths here and there. I noticed that some of the JS is broken but I can't remember if it was always like that or not. Oh well.

To run it, do a `docker compose up` and then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
